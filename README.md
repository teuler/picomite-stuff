# picomite-stuff

I used a Windows 11 PC, with the Python Anaconda distribution installed. 
I added (through the Anaconda.Navigator; yes, I know, it is so slow ...) the `git` package and used for the shell commands below the Anaconda Powershell prompt.


1. Create a new folder that hosts all parts (e.g., ``picomite'')
2. Change to that folder
3. Clone the pico sdk:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
    ```
